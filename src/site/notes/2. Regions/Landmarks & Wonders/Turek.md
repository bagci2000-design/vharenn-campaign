The starting Island for the party.

Turek is an island not often spoken of beyond its shores. Blessed by distance and geography, its people have lived apart from the shifting tides of Vharennâ€™s politics. Life here has long been marked by simplicity â€” fishing the coasts, tending small farms, and honouring the quiet rhythms of land and sea.

The island itself is rugged yet beautiful: windswept cliffs ring the coastline, while the interior holds rolling forests, freshwater springs, and the faint ruins of settlements long abandoned. Few outsiders once claimed more than a passing interest in Turek, for it lacks the great ports, mines, or treasures that draw fortune-seekers elsewhere.

In recent years, however, more ships have found their way to Turekâ€™s harbours. Officials, priests, and merchants from distant lands have begun arriving with promises of trade, faith, and protection. For the locals, it is a curious shift â€” after generations of quiet independence, strangers now walk their streets with banners and coin, each eager to make their mark.

To most beyond its shores, Turek is still a name that barely registers â€” a remote isle with little to offer but peace, salt air, and a way of life that seemed untouched by the wider world. But for those who live upon it, the times are changing.
