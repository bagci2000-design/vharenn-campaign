The starting Island for the party.

Turek is an island not often spoken of beyond its shores. Blessed by distance and geography, its people have lived apart from the shifting tides of Vharenn’s politics. Life here has long been marked by simplicity — fishing the coasts, tending small farms, and honouring the quiet rhythms of land and sea.

The island itself is rugged yet beautiful: windswept cliffs ring the coastline, while the interior holds rolling forests, freshwater springs, and the faint ruins of settlements long abandoned. Few outsiders once claimed more than a passing interest in Turek, for it lacks the great ports, mines, or treasures that draw fortune-seekers elsewhere.

In recent years, however, more ships have found their way to Turek’s harbours. Officials, priests, and merchants from distant lands have begun arriving with promises of trade, faith, and protection. For the locals, it is a curious shift — after generations of quiet independence, strangers now walk their streets with banners and coin, each eager to make their mark.

To most beyond its shores, Turek is still a name that barely registers — a remote isle with little to offer but peace, salt air, and a way of life that seemed untouched by the wider world. But for those who live upon it, the times are changing.

## 🔥 **The Burned Storehouse**

### 📍 Key Features

- **Collapsed Roof (Top-Left):** Burned wooden beams and rubble provide difficult terrain, blocking line of sight.
    
- **Scorched Floor (Center):** Three large burn marks, one still faintly glowing red (arcane fire residue), two with dull blue runes — investigation checks can reveal sabotage rather than a natural blaze.
    
- **Crates & Barrels (Scattered):** Act as cover in combat; some are intact, others smashed.
    
- **Dockside (Right):** A small stone pier connecting to the sea; smugglers may have used this to flee.
    
- **Alleyways (Top & Bottom):** Access routes for witnesses, reinforcements, or ambushers.
    
- **Cobblestone Street (Outside):** Where Tribunal patrols (or PCs) can enter.
    

### ⚔️ Possible Encounters

- **Vault Smuggler Scout:** Hiding among crates or slipping out via the dock.
    
- **Suspicious Locals:** In the alleys, bribed to “swear” Thornhold caused it.
    
- **Environmental Hazard:** Weak floor beams collapse if heavy combat happens near the central scorch marks (Dex save DC 13 to avoid falling prone/damage).
    

### 🎲 Skill Check Opportunities

- **Arcana DC 15:** Fire was magical, not mundane.
    
- **Investigation DC 13:** Smuggler boot prints lead toward the docks.
    
- **Persuasion/Intimidation DC 12:** Locals admit they were bribed to blame Thornhold.






![Sacred Spring.png](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Sacred%20Spring.png)

## 🌿 **Sacred Spring Map Features**

### 📍 Key Elements

- **Central Spring:** A small freshwater pool, sacred to Thornhold. Clear water bubbles gently from underground.
    
- **Standing Stones:** Six ancient stones form a rough circle around the spring, etched with faint druidic runes. Arcana or Religion checks can reveal their significance.
    
- **Forest Clearing:** The area is open enough for combat but surrounded by dense trees, making it easy for ambushers to hide.
    
- **Paths In/Out:** Three narrow dirt trails lead to the clearing (north, south, and east), useful for staging patrols or ranger entrances.
    
- **Scattered Rocks & Bushes:** Provide half-cover in combat, good for archers or guerrilla tactics.
    

### ⚔️ Possible Encounters

- **Frostbrand Patrol:** Detaining locals near the spring; could escalate into combat.
    
- **Thornhold Rangers:** Watching from the treeline, ready to intervene or test the PCs.
    
- **Nature’s Wrath:** Druids may animate vines or roots if the spring is threatened.
    

### 🎲 Skill Opportunities

- **Nature/Arcana DC 14:** The spring is naturally magical, tied to the island’s lifeforce.
    
- **Persuasion DC 15:** PCs can defuse the standoff between soldiers and locals.
    
- **Stealth DC 13:** PCs can slip around the clearing to eavesdrop before acting.


![Smuggler's Cove.png](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Smuggler's%20Cove.png)

## 🌊 **Smugglers’ Cove Map Features**

### 📍 Key Elements

- **Shoreline Entrance (Bottom-Left):** Sandy beach where the tide recedes, revealing access into the cave. Perfect ambush point if PCs enter cautiously.
    
- **Wooden Docks (Center):** A large cross-shaped dock with a rowboat tied up. Smugglers use this to unload contraband from hidden ships.
    
- **Cargo Stashes (Top-Right):** Crates and barrels stacked in corners, filled with trade goods, weapons, or food supplies. Searching here may reveal the stolen **Vault ledger**.
    
- **Campfire (Bottom-Right):** Smugglers’ resting spot with benches. Provides light but also alerts anyone sneaking in.
    
- **Rocky Cover (Edges):** Natural stone formations create choke points, cover for archers, and opportunities for stealth.
    

### ⚔️ Possible Encounters

- **Smuggler Guards (4–6):** Positioned near docks and campfire, ready to defend their goods.
    
- **Smuggler Leader:** At the campfire or by the ledger crates.
    
- **Vault Connection:** Documents tying the smugglers back to Leviathan Vault — or to Thornhold bribery — depending on what evidence you want revealed.
    

### 🎲 Skill Opportunities

- **Stealth DC 13:** PCs can approach silently from the beach.
    
- **Investigation DC 12:** Find hidden compartments in crates with contraband and ledgers.
    
- **Athletics DC 15:** Climb the cave walls to locate the hidden escape tunnel to the cliffs above.
