A grizzled Frostbrand officer not solely stationed anywhere on Turek but a travelling guard and enforcer. Korrin is loyal to the Tribunal but weary of constant resistance from locals. His harsh methods — intimidation, threats, and punishment — come from frustration as much as malice. He represents the Tribunal’s most unflattering face: order through fear.
