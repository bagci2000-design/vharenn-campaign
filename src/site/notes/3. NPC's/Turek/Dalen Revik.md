Once a Human pirate captain, Dalen bought his freedom by swearing loyalty to a Vault merchant prince upon his capture for his crimes of piracy, though his true allegiance is to coin. Now, he operates as an envoy, preferring manipulation and charm to open violence. He dreams of turning the island into a lucrative hub â€” not through conquest, but through contracts, debt, and smuggling. To him, loyalty is for sale. He does hold the agenda of wishing to topple over all of the prevailing factions on the island including the leviathan vault if need be to make his dreams of unimaginable wealth a reality.
