A Veylen druid descended from [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Thornhold\|Thornhold]]’s oldest bloodlines, Eira claims her ancestors once bound themselves to the island’s land and spirits. Calm, patient, and deliberate, she sees herself as a guardian against foreign desecration. She believes the Tribunal and Vault are corrupting forces. With witnessing the death of [[3. NPC's/Turek/Dalen Revik\|Dalen Revik]], she has now shifted to be willing to utilise warfare to achieve her wishes of preserving the beauty of [[2. Regions/Landmarks & Wonders/Turek\|Turek]]
