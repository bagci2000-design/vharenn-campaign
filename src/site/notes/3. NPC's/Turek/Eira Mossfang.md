A human druid descended from [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Thornhold\|Thornhold]]’s oldest bloodlines, Eira claims her ancestors once bound themselves to the island’s land and spirits. Calm, patient, and deliberate, she sees herself as a guardian against foreign desecration. She believes the Tribunal and Vault are corrupting forces.
