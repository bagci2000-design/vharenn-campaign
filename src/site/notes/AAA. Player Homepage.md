-Each of the party on their own path in life feel an otherworldly presence, an omnipresent stare, a divine being. A whisper is heard, booming yet quiet, the words heard **“Come to the island, chosen of fate. Your strength, your cunning, your faith, and your craft will shape what must come. Alone you may falter — together, you will lead the way.” (Please refer to your Whatsapp message for your private ending, Do not under any circumstances share this with any other party member, no exceptions)**
-The party all awake time post hearing the whisper blurred together, Memories faded, Out of body experience removing any semblance over control of their actions.
