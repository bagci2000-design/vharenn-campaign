Vharenn’s technology rests on the **Late Iron Age to Early Renaissance** spectrum, though progress is uneven—pockets of sophisticated innovation exist alongside regions still working with wood and bronze. Steelworking, wind and water mills, mechanical clockworks, glassblowing, and advanced shipbuilding are common in major cities. Vergir forges produce superior steel and intricate clockwork mechanisms, while the Tideforged dominate maritime engineering with deep-hull ships and pressure-proof diving bells.

Factions influence technological spread. Thornhold’s siege engines blend Ironholt metallurgy with Alabaster runes, while the Crimson Banner refines crossbows and war wagons for mobility. Seasonal Courts have little interest in industrial tech, focusing on alchemical brews, living constructs, and oaths woven into everyday tools. The Alabaster Concordat uses magic to automate some processes but tightly controls public access.
