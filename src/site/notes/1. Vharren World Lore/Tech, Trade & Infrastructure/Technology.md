Vharenn’s technology rests on the **Late Iron Age to Early Renaissance** spectrum, though progress is uneven—pockets of sophisticated innovation exist alongside regions still working with wood and bronze. Steelworking, wind and water mills, mechanical clockworks, glassblowing, and advanced shipbuilding are common in major cities. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] forges produce superior steel and intricate clockwork mechanisms, while the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Tideforged\|Tideforged]] dominate maritime engineering with deep-hull ships and pressure-proof diving bells.

Factions influence technological spread. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Thornhold\|Thornhold]]’s siege engines blend Ironholt metallurgy with Alabaster runes, while the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]] refines crossbows and war wagons for mobility. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Seasonal Courts\|Seasonal Courts]] have little interest in industrial tech, focusing on alchemical brews, living constructs, and oaths woven into everyday tools. The [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Alabaster Concordat\|Alabaster Concordat]] uses magic to automate some processes but tightly controls public access.
