Trade thrives in **free cities, coastal hubs, and seasonal markets**. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Remnant Thrones\|Remnant Thrones]] export fine textiles, wine, and carved stone; the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]] trades weapons and mercenary contracts; Ironholt and the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] sell steel goods and clockwork devices. The [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Seasonal Courts\|Seasonal Courts]] offer rare fey materials—moon-silk, whisperwood, and bottled springlight—at unpredictable intervals.

The primary currency is the **Crown**, struck in gold, silver, and copper. Large transactions use **trade bars** or **sealed promissory notes** backed by banking houses in major cities. In rural areas, barter still dominates—grain, livestock, and crafted goods.

Black markets flourish where faction influence is weak or divided, dealing in stolen relics, illegal magic, poisons, and proscribed texts. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Leviathan Vault\|Leviathan Vault]] smugglers move contraband across oceans, while Pyreborn cells sell alchemical firepowders to warlords.
