Trade thrives in **free cities, coastal hubs, and seasonal markets**. Remnant Thrones export fine textiles, wine, and carved stone; the Crimson Banner trades weapons and mercenary contracts; Ironholt and the Vergir sell steel goods and clockwork devices. The Seasonal Courts offer rare fey materials—moon-silk, whisperwood, and bottled springlight—at unpredictable intervals.

The primary currency is the **Crown**, struck in gold, silver, and copper. Large transactions use **trade bars** or **sealed promissory notes** backed by banking houses in major cities. In rural areas, barter still dominates—grain, livestock, and crafted goods.

Black markets flourish where faction influence is weak or divided, dealing in stolen relics, illegal magic, poisons, and proscribed texts. Leviathan Vault smugglers move contraband across oceans, while Pyreborn cells sell alchemical firepowders to warlords.
