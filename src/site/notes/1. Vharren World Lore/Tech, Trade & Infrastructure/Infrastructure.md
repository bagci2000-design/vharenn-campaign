Vharenn’s travel arteries are a blend of **imperial legacies** and **patchwork regional roads**. The **Remnant Highways**, built by the old empire, are still the fastest overland routes—paved stone, mile markers, and fortified waystations every 30 miles. Many smaller roads are dirt or cobblestone and poorly maintained in contested regions.

Sea travel rivals overland speed. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Tideforged\|Tideforged]] harbours along the coasts provide deepwater docks, shipwrights, and skilled navigators. Merchant galleons ferry grain, salt, iron, and textiles between ports. River barges carry timber and ore from inland mines to coastal cities.

Communication flows through **messenger guilds**, magical relay stones in major cities, and trained **courier birds**. The [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Shattered Mask\|Shattered Mask]] and the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Web of the Forgotten Queen\|Web of the Forgotten Queen]] both infiltrate these networks for information control.

Control of infrastructure is as valuable as territory. Factions guard choke points—mountain passes, river mouths, key bridges—as fiercely as fortresses. Caravans and ships pay tolls or tariffs to pass safely, though “protection” is sometimes indistinguishable from extortion.
