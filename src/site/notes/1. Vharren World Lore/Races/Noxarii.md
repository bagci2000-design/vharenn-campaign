## üêç **Noxarii**

The Noxarii are a rare and secretive serpentfolk whose history winds through the oldest myths of Vharenn. Known for their keen intellect and cold-blooded patience, they often live in isolation or within hidden enclaves far from prying eyes. Their cultural values lean toward **Lawful Neutral** or **Neutral Evil**, placing calculated order above sentiment. Politically, they maintain quiet but meaningful ties to the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Silent Choir\|Silent Choir]] and certain clandestine knowledge cults. Relations with other races are strained‚Äî[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Tideforged\|Tideforged]] mistrust them due to ancient betrayals, [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Emberkin\|Emberkin]] see them as heretics, and most mortals fear them instinctively. Noxarii adventurers rarely reveal their full heritage, travelling under disguise or in secrecy. Their motives can range from recovering lost relics to manipulating events toward long-laid goals. Whether feared as assassins, revered as sages, or dismissed as myths, the Noxarii walk the line between predator and philosopher, seeing the world through eyes sharpened by centuries of memory.

The Noxarii are shadow-touched humanoids who thrive in low light. Their skin is dusky or midnight black, their eyes glowing faintly with silver, violet, or crimson. They excel at stealth, subterfuge, and the weaving of shadow magic. Noxarii settlements are often built underground or in the perpetual gloom of deep forests and fog-laden valleys. Their culture values secrecy, patience, and the slow accumulation of influence.

Though distrusted by many, Noxarii are fiercely loyal to those who treat them as equals. Their religious practices often venerate deities of night, memory, or hidden knowledge.
