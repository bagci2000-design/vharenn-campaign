## üßë‚Äçüåæ **Humans**

Humans are the most populous race in Vharenn, scattered across nearly every region and culture. Their adaptability is both their greatest strength and their greatest flaw. Human kingdoms rise and fall with dizzying speed, and their ambitions often extend beyond their own borders. Because of their varied upbringings, humans can embody any moral alignment, though most lean toward **Neutral** or **Chaotic** tendencies depending on regional stability. They are found in nearly every faction, from the disciplined [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]] to the secretive [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Alabaster Concordat\|Alabaster Concordat]]. Other races often see humans as opportunists‚Äîpragmatic and willing to compromise morals for survival or power. While mistrusted in some circles, humans are equally capable of heroism, leadership, or treachery. Adventuring humans might be disinherited nobles seeking glory, commoners hungry for freedom, or exiles fleeing the consequences of political games. Their ability to integrate almost anywhere makes them unpredictable allies and formidable rivals.
Humans are the most adaptable people of Vharenn, their settlements ranging from the wind-swept cliff cities of the west to the rice terraces carved into the eastern highlands. While shorter-lived than many other races, they possess a drive and resilience that allows them to thrive under almost any conditions. In Vharenn‚Äôs turbulent history, humans have often been both conquerors and the conquered, forming kingdoms, free cities, and mercenary companies across the land.

Human cultures vary wildly depending on their homeland. Northern highlanders tend to value clan loyalty and martial prowess, while southern traders prize wit, negotiation, and wealth. The coastal realms lean on shipbuilding and exploration, their fleets connecting disparate corners of the realm. Though humans lack the inherent magical gifts of some other races, their versatility in combat, diplomacy, and craftsmanship makes them indispensable in mixed societies.

Their politics are equally diverse. Some human nations are ruled by hereditary monarchs, others by councils or merchant princes. Faith is common, but often tied to pragmatic needs‚Äîgods of harvest, sea, and war find more temples than gods of philosophy or artistry. Above all, humans tend to adapt quickly to whatever powers hold sway, whether faction, deity, or foreign race.
