## ðŸ§Š **Glacari**

The Glacari are descendants of frost giants and elemental spirits, living embodiments of winterâ€™s endurance. Towering and broad, they command an aura of respect tempered by their reserved nature. Their alignments are most often **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Lawful Good or Lawful Neutral]]**, valuing honour and oaths above all else. They lead the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Frostbrand Tribunal\|Frostbrand Tribunal]], an ancient judicial order, and maintain strong ties with the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Bloodbound\|Bloodbound]]. Rivalries with [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Emberkin\|Emberkin]] stem from deep elemental oppositions, while their relations with [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] are rooted in mutual respect. Adventuring Glacari may be exiled judges, emissaries to warmer lands, or warriors seeking to settle ancient scores. In battle, their presence is as steady and unyielding as ice, and in politics, their word carries the weight of unbroken tradition.

The **Glacari** are pale, sharp-featured folk whose breath always mists and whose hair glints like hoarfrost. They prize clarity, oath-keeping, and measured speech; a promise spoken on winter air is binding in their custom. Many dwell in the **[[2. Regions/Key Areas/Frostbrand Reach\|Frostbrand Reach]]**, serving as wardens, arbiters, and ice-road guides. Their artistry favors scrimshaw runes, blue-white glasswork, and songs that carry for miles across frozen lakes. Most honor **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Pantheon/Velthar\|Velthar]]** (judgment, winter) and **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Pantheon/Tavren\|Tavren]]** (oaths). Their alignments trend **Lawful Neutral** to **Lawful Good**, though pragmatism can harden into severity. Public festivals include **Icebloom Day (Snowmelt 22)**, for blessing homes, and the **Frozen Pact (Frostwane 6)**, an oath-renewal rite held on black ice. Outsiders find Glacari cool but dependable: their word holds in storm or siege, and their justiceâ€”though coldâ€”is seldom cruel.
