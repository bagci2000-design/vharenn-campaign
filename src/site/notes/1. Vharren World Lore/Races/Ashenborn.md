## ☠️ **Ashenborn**

The Ashenborn are the undying remnants of warriors and citizens caught in the devastation of the God-Wars. Bound to a half-life, they walk the world with bodies that endure but hearts that have known only loss. Their morality is shaped by endless time, leaning toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Neutral Good or Chaotic Neutral]]**, though prolonged existence can drive some toward apathy. They rarely swear allegiance to any faction, but some serve [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Thornhold\|Thornhold]] or act as neutral advisers to rulers seeking ancient perspective. They are pitied by the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Veylen\|Veylen]], feared by [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Humans\|Humans]], and quietly respected by [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Glacari\|Glacari]] for their endurance. Adventuring Ashenborn are often motivated by quests to reclaim meaning—protecting the living, righting ancient wrongs, or simply experiencing something new in a world they’ve wandered for centuries. To the Ashenborn, every moment is a borrowed ember, and they carry it with a steady, if weary, determination.

The Ashenborn are a cursed offshoot of humanity, their skin marked with grey, black, and ember-hued patterns as though dusted with soot or touched by fire’s shadow. They dwell near volcanic ranges, ash deserts, and regions once scarred by magical calamity. Theirs is a hard life, shaped by heat, scarcity, and a cultural memory of exile. Many outsiders view them with suspicion, believing the Ashenborn to be harbingers of misfortune, yet their endurance is legendary.

Their settlements are often built into basalt cliffs or around geothermal springs, using volcanic heat to forge metal or grow crops in otherwise barren lands. Ashenborn warriors favour polearms and flame-tempered blades, their armour blackened to match their volcanic homes. Spiritually, they walk a fine line—some revere fire as a cleansing, life-giving force, while others see it as an inevitable destroyer to be feared and appeased.

While rarely invited into high politics, the Ashenborn produce formidable mercenaries, survivalists, and scouts. Their leaders are chosen based on merit and trial-by-ordeal, not lineage.
