## 🕷️ **Chitari**

The Chitari are half-spider deepfolk known for their mastery of weaving both silk and intrigue. Living in subterranean cities, they thrive in environments where patience and planning dictate survival. They align most often with **Neutral Evil** or **True Neutral**, prioritising the survival and influence of their matriarchal houses. Many operate within the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Web of the Forgotten Queen\|Web of the Forgotten Queen]]**, manipulating events from the shadows. Relations are tense—[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Bloodbound\|Bloodbound]] mistrust them, [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Mirrorkin\|Mirrorkin]] work alongside them in covert operations, and most surface races fear their appearance and methods. Adventuring Chitari may be spies, exiles, or ambitious webweavers seeking influence above ground. Whether seen as predators or protectors, their every move is deliberate, and every thread they spin connects to a greater design only they can see.

The Chitari are agile, feline-like, blending humanoid form with sleek musculature, ears, and tails reminiscent of great cats. Their eyes reflect light in darkness, and their senses of hearing and smell are unmatched among mortals. Communities are semi-nomadic, moving between seasonal hunting grounds or following migratory prey. They prize freedom, personal skill, and loyalty to their pride above all else. Status is earned through deeds—most often in hunting, scouting, or protecting the community. Oral traditions preserve epic hunts and trickster tales, passed from elder to kit. Spiritual beliefs revolve around the **Great Hunt**, a metaphor for life’s trials and predator-prey cycles. They avoid needless bloodshed, preferring agility and stealth over brute force.
