## ðŸ”¥ **Emberkin**

The Emberkin are descendants of those touched by divine fire during the Divine Collapse. Their blood burns with an unquenchable energy that manifests in fierce passion, destructive tempers, and an almost religious drive toward change. Alignments often lean toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Alignment\|Chaotic Neutral or Chaotic Evil]]**, though some use their power for good. Emberkin often gather in the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Pyreborn Circle\|Pyreborn Circle]] or find work in warlike factions where their intensity is valued. Rivalries with [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Glacari\|Glacari]] run deep, fuelled by ancient elemental conflicts, and [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] tend to see them as dangerously unstable. Adventuring Emberkin may be seeking release for their inner fire, destruction of perceived corruption, or redemption from the chaos theyâ€™ve caused. Wherever they go, they leave a markâ€”sometimes a blazing trail of inspiration, sometimes nothing but ash.

The Emberkin are descendants of an ancient pact between mortals and elemental fire. They are not cursed like the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Ashenborn\|Ashenborn]], but blessedâ€”or burdenedâ€”with a spark of the elemental in their veins. This manifests as faint glowing lines beneath their skin, warmth radiating from their bodies, and eyes that flicker like candle flames. Emberkin are rare and often wanderers, for their elemental heritage can make them feel out of place in any one community.

They are drawn to creation and destruction alikeâ€”blacksmiths, pyromancers, warlords, and artists of firelight theatre. Emberkin view fire as a metaphor for life: brief, bright, and always hungry. They are passionate, prone to extremes of loyalty or wrath, and slow to forgive those who wrong them.

While most Emberkin are born to Emberkin parents, occasionally one appears in another race, sparking rumours of hidden ancestry or divine intervention. Such children are often feared or venerated, depending on local beliefs.
