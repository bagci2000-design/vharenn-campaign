## ðŸŒŠ **Tideforged**

The Tideforged are living constructs of coral, brass, and enchanted stone, created by oceanic powers to defend the seasâ€™ deepest realms. Long abandoned by their creators, they now seek new purpose on the surface or in the coastal cities. Their alignments tend toward **Lawful Neutral** or **True Neutral**, bound by the vestiges of their original programming yet capable of independent thought. They serve as guardians of the Leviathan Vault and sometimes hire themselves out as mercenaries or ship protectors. Relations are formalâ€”Fellborn are treated as kindred outsiders, Noxarii with suspicion, and Emberkin as dangerously volatile. Adventuring Tideforged might seek to protect maritime trade routes, recover lost knowledge of their creation, or adapt to life in a world that was not built for them. Their presence on land is both a curiosity and a reminder that the ocean holds secrets older and stranger than the land could imagine.

The Tideforged are a seafaring race whose skin bears the colours and patterns of ocean stoneâ€”blues, greens, and greysâ€”often marked with shell-like ridges or coral-like growths. Gills along their necks allow them to breathe underwater for limited periods. They are natural sailors, fisherfolk, and explorers, with an intuitive sense for tides and currents.

Tideforged communities cluster along coasts, islands, and river deltas. They revere the sea as both mother and grave, offering ritual gifts to ensure safe voyages. Their ships are masterpieces of craftsmanship, blending speed and durability. While they prefer peaceful trade, they are no strangers to naval warfare when their waters are threatened.

Their art and music often mimic the rhythms of waves, and their oral histories stretch back to before recorded human settlement.
