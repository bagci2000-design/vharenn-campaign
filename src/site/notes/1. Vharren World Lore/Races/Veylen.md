## ðŸŒ™ **Veylen**

The Veylen are an ancient, dwindling people tied to dreams, memory, and the slow passage of time. Once rulers of sprawling, enchanted domains, many now retreat to the Umbralwood, guarding secrets too dangerous to fade. Veylen often embody **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Neutral Good]]** ideals of balance and stewardship, but centuries of loss have pushed some toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Chaotic Neutral]]** detachment. They frequently align with the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Seasonal Courts\|Seasonal Courts]], and some work within the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Alabaster Concordat\|Alabaster Concordat]] to preserve arcane knowledge. Their relationships with other races are cautiousâ€”[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Humans\|Humans]] are seen as hasty and reckless, [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Grimkin\|Grimkin]] as kindred spirits, and [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Fellborn\|Fellborn]] as tragic reminders of corruption. Veylen adventurers are often those who cannot bear isolation any longer, who seek to protect or recover lost relics, or who are driven by visions of possible futures. They carry an unspoken melancholy, knowing their peopleâ€™s decline is likely inevitable, yet still striving to shape the dreams of Vharennâ€™s tomorrow.

The Veylen are an amphibious race resembling a blend of human and deep-sea predator. Their skin is smooth and dark, often patterned with bioluminescent spots. Their eyes are adapted for darkness, and they can remain submerged for extended periods.

Veylen dwell in areas with access the deep ocean trenches and in hidden lagoons, emerging solely to interact and engage with other races to interact with surface dwellers. Their society is highly hierarchical, with power concentrated in the hands of the strongest hunters and most gifted seers. They are deeply spiritual, venerating the abyss as a place of both death and rebirth.
