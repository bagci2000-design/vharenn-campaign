## ðŸª“ **Bloodbound**

The Bloodbound are tall, broad-shouldered nomadic warriors descended from giant-blooded ancestors. Honour is the foundation of their culture, and oaths are binding to the soul. Most Bloodbound follow **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Alignment\|Lawful Good or Lawful Evil]]** codes, though mercenary life may blur these lines. They are often found serving as shock troops for the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]] or roaming in Freeblade Clans, taking contracts that align with their principles. They maintain mutual respect with [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Glacari\|Glacari]], whose own code of honour mirrors their own, but old rivalries with [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Emberkin\|Emberkin]] have sparked many bloody feuds. Adventuring Bloodbound may be on a rite of passage, seeking to restore family honour, or pursuing vengeance for a broken oathâ€”whether their own or anotherâ€™s. Fierce in battle, loyal to allies, and relentless against foes, the Bloodbound are both feared and admired for the unyielding strength of their word.

The Bloodbound are a rare race born of ancient bargains between mortals and vampiric entities. They are pale-skinned, with sharp, slightly elongated canines and eyes that gleam unnaturally in low light. Contrary to common fear, they are not mindless predatorsâ€”though blood sustains them, they can survive on minimal intake for long periods if necessary.

Bloodbound society is secretive, existing in shadow alongside other civilizations. They organize into covenantsâ€”extended families or sworn groups bound by blood pacts. Honour within a covenant is absolute, and betrayal is punished harshly. They excel in roles where charm, manipulation, and precision are valued.

While some Bloodbound embrace their predatory nature, others seek to live quietly among other races, suppressing their hungers. Rumours persist that their origin is tied to an ancient plague or curse.
