## ü©∏ **Fellborn**

Fellborn are mortals permanently marked by the touch of the Deep Realms. Their appearance may carry subtle or striking distortions‚Äîunusual eyes, warped auras, or faintly inhuman features‚Äîthat set them apart from the untainted. While some embrace this legacy, others live under its shadow. Most lean toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Neutral Evil or Chaotic Good]]**, their morality shaped by how the world treats them. Fellborn often find acceptance in [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Thornhold\|Thornhold]]‚Äôs cultic circles or among outlaw bands, though they are rarely welcomed in structured political courts. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Humans\|Humans]] tend to fear them, [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Veylen\|Veylen]] mistrust them, while [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Tideforged\|Tideforged]] show them cautious respect, seeing them as fellow outcasts. Many Fellborn adventurers are driven by the desire to prove themselves, master the powers their heritage grants, or uncover the truth of their altered bloodline. In a world that doubts their loyalty, every choice they make carries the weight of their heritage‚Äôs stigma.

Fellborn are children of the liminal hours‚Äîthose born beneath eclipses, beside grave-roads, or in places where night never seems to lift. Their eyes catch starlight even at noon, and their voices carry a faint echo, as if some quiet room is always listening. Most Fellborn grow up in tight-knit street-cloisters or funeral guilds, learning to read omens, keep vigils, and speak gently with the grieving. They‚Äôre not undead, nor cursed by default; they‚Äôre simply attuned to the hush between heartbeats. Many honour **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Pantheon/Aivora\|Aivora]]** (moon and memory) or **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Pantheon/Morrath\|Morrath]]** (the last kindness), serve as lantern-bearers for night watches, or keep ‚Äúremembrance books‚Äù for those the world has forgotten. Outsiders mistake their reserve for menace, but Fellborn communities prize hospitality and debts paid in full. Typical alignments trend **Neutral** to **Chaotic Neutral**; law-abiding in their own codes, wary of institutions that demand daylight confessions. Common ties: **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Silent Choir\|Silent Choir]]** (ritual containment), **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Shattered Mask\|Shattered Mask]]** (identity arts), and cautious trade with the **Web**. Their holy night is **Shadow‚Äôs Mercy (Shadewane 2)**‚Äîa citywide vigil where every lamp is left burning for the lost.
