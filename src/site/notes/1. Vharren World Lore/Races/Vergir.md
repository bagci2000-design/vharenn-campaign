## ⛏️ Vergir

The Vergir are the deepfolk of Vharenn, renowned for their stonecraft, metallurgy, and unshakable traditions. Generations spent in mountain strongholds and deep mines have made them resilient but wary of outsiders. Their society prizes discipline and communal responsibility, often leading to a **Lawful Neutral** worldview, though political or clan disputes can push individuals toward **Lawful Evil**. The Vergir have strong ties to the Remnant Thrones, offering weapons and fortifications in exchange for political influence. They also serve as master engineers for the Crimson Banner. Relations with other races are pragmatic—Grimkin are seen as unreliable, Emberkin as dangerously unstable, while Glacari earn their respect through shared honour codes. Adventuring Vergir are often exiles from clan politics, master smiths seeking rare materials, or mercenaries safeguarding caravans. Whether above or below ground, they remain proud of their heritage, carrying the weight of a stoneblood curse that has shaped their culture’s caution and perseverance.

The Vergir are stocky, mountain-dwelling folk renowned for their metallurgy, engineering, and insular communities. Their deep halls are hewn into the roots of Vharenn’s mountains, carved with runes that tell the history of their clans. Tradition and craft are their lifeblood—each Vergir is expected to master a trade, whether smithing, stonecutting, brewing, or rune-lore.

Most outsiders view them as stubborn and slow to change, but to the Vergir, change without reason is folly. Honour is the foundation of their society, and oaths are sacred—breaking one is an unforgivable stain. Though they rarely involve themselves in surface politics, their skill in crafting weapons, armour, and machines makes them valuable allies and dangerous enemies. Vergir trade caravans are heavily guarded and known to bring goods of unmatched quality.

Magic among the Vergir tends to be subtle—runes etched into steel, wards woven into walls, and forges blessed to burn hotter than mortal fire. Their reverence for the mountains extends to a belief that the stone itself remembers everything that has happened within it.
