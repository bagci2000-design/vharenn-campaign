## ðŸª¶ **Vyrathi**

The Vyrathi are ravenfolk whose culture is steeped in omens, death, and the whispers of passing souls. Feared and respected in equal measure, they are often seen as messengers between worlds. They tend toward **Neutral Good** or **Neutral Evil**, with morality shaped by the weight of prophecy. They avoid formal faction ties, though some work within the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Alabaster Concordat\|Alabaster Concordat]] or as contracted seers for the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Silent Choir\|Silent Choir]]. Many races treat them with wary respectâ€”[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Bloodbound\|Bloodbound]] acknowledge their messages as binding, while [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Humans\|Humans]] and [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] regard them with suspicion. Adventuring Vyrathi may leave their flocks to follow a vision, deliver a crucial warning, or uncover the source of troubling omens. Their presence is often met with unease, for to see a Vyrathi on the road is to wonder whether they bring news of lifeâ€¦ or death.

Tall, lithe, and serpentine in grace, the Vyrathi are a semi-nomadic race descended from ancient desert kings and priestesses. Their skin bears subtle scales along the spine and arms, and their eyes have the vertical pupils of a serpent. They are known for their fluid, hypnotic speech and ritual dances that are said to sway hearts as easily as the wind shapes dunes.

The Vyrathi value knowledge, trade, and prestige above brute force. Their caravans cross the Great Southern Wastes, carrying rare spices, silks, and relics between the city-states. Vyrathi society is structured around Housesâ€”extended families with complex alliances and rivalries. Honour is public, but power is built in shadow through marriage, debt, and whispered bargains.

Religion among the Vyrathi is steeped in ancestor worship and veneration of gods tied to the sun, moon, and shifting sands. They are wary of magic not tied to their traditions, but masterful at using illusion, divination, and subtle enchantments.
