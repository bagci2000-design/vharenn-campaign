## 🪞 **Mirrorkin**

The Mirrorkin are reflections of alternate timelines, living beings whose existence is an anomaly. Their features may shift subtly over time, and their sense of identity is often fluid. Most align with **Chaotic Neutral** or **Chaotic Good**, navigating life through reinvention. They are strongly associated with the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Shattered Mask\|Shattered Mask]] network, a shadowy organisation that values their ability to assume roles and manipulate perception. Relationships with other races are cautious—[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Chitari\|Chitari]] find utility in them, while most others remain suspicious of their changing nature. Adventuring Mirrorkin may be driven to find their “true” self, resolve anomalies in their past, or manipulate the future in their favour. To outsiders, they are enigmas—sometimes friends, sometimes strangers—always a reminder that reality itself is not as fixed as it seems.

The Mirrorkin are a rare and unsettling race whose features seem subtly wrong—eyes that reflect too perfectly, movements that mirror those around them. Born rarely among other races, Mirrorkin often live as outsiders, feared for their uncanny ability to mimic voices, faces, and even thoughts with disturbing accuracy.

Legends suggest they hail from another realm, a place of endless reflection and echo. They are natural spies, infiltrators, and illusionists, though many struggle with questions of identity and belonging.
