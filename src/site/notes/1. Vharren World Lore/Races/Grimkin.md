## üêæ **Grimkin**

The Grimkin are small, fey-touched wanderers whose lives straddle the line between the mortal and the magical. Often described as clever scavengers or playful tricksters, they survive by wits, charm, and an uncanny knack for escaping danger. Many Grimkin lean toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Chaotic Good or Chaotic Neutral]]** alignments, valuing freedom over law and wit over brute force. Rarely loyal to any faction, they sometimes work alongside the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Seasonal Courts\|Seasonal Courts]] or operate as unaffiliated traders, spies, or guides. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] see them as unreliable, while [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Veylen\|Veylen]] view them as distant cousins touched by the same ancient magic. [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Human\|Human]] tend to underestimate them‚Äîoften a costly mistake. Adventuring Grimkin might be driven by wanderlust, curiosity, or the thrill of pulling off one last trick. Though often underestimated, a Grimkin‚Äôs small stature belies their adaptability and survival skills, making them unpredictable allies and resourceful troublemakers in equal measure.

The Grimkin are small, wiry humanoids with skin in shades of grey or earthy brown, sharp features, and eyes that gleam like polished stones. Known for their cunning and mischief, they inhabit marshes, ruins, and forgotten corners of cities. Grimkin are scavengers, tinkers, and illusionists, adept at surviving where others might perish.

Their society is loosely structured, with shifting alliances and a focus on personal gain‚Äîthough bonds of friendship can run deep. Grimkin value wit and guile over brute strength, often using trickery to outmatch physically stronger foes.

Many Grimkin are talented alchemists or inventors, producing devices both ingenious and dangerously unstable.
