## **Frostbrand Tribunal**

An ancient order of **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Glacari\|Glacari]] judges and warriors**, the Frostbrand Tribunal is tasked with upholding sacred oaths and mediating disputes of great consequence. Their alignment ranges from **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Lawful Good to Lawful Neutral]]**, and they operate with unwavering adherence to their code.

Their rulings are binding; refusal to accept them is a grave insult, punishable by **exile** or **execution**. The Tribunal maintains strong ties to the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Bloodbound\|Bloodbound]]** and occasional diplomatic channels with the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Remnant Thrones\|Remnant Thrones]]**. Rivalries with the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Pyreborn Circle\|Pyreborn Circle]]** are fierce, rooted in both ideological and elemental opposition.

Adventurers tied to the Tribunal may serve as **emissaries**, **oath-bound defenders**, or **exiles** seeking redemption. To walk under their banner is to embody **honour** itselfâ€”and to carry the weight of ensuring truth is upheld, no matter the cost.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- **Duels of Honour** serve as formal legal processes, fought with ritualised weapons on frozen lakes.
- **Ice-carved effigies** of the guilty are displayed until they thaw.
- **Player-Facing:** Produce fine steel, iceglass, and rare winter herbs with potent medicinal or hallucinogenic properties.
