##  **Web of the Forgotten Queen**

The Web of the Forgotten Queen is a **clandestine network** led by powerful **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Chitari\|Chitari]] matriarchs**, operating from hidden strongholds. They weave **information**, **influence**, and **assassinations** into a tapestry of control, avoiding open conflict in favour of **manipulation**, **blackmail**, and the **strategic removal** of threats.

Their alignment leans toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Neutral Evil]]**, with loyalty directed toward the stability and power of their own kin above all else. **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Mirrorkin\|Mirrorkin]]** operatives often act as their agents, and they maintain uneasy truces with other shadow organisations, including a wary relationship with the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Shattered Mask\|Shattered Mask]]**.

Adventurers tied to the Web might be **trained infiltrators**, **escaped pawns**, or **brokers of dangerous information**. To work for the Web is to understand that **trust is currency** and **betrayal is inevitable**. Service may bring power and protection, but failure—or crossing the Queen—often ends lives in ways no one sees coming.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- **Weave-giving**: ceremonial presentation of spider-silk tokens signalling trust or obligation. Betrayal after receiving one is considered unforgivable.
- Operate an underground network for smuggling rare poisons, exotic silks, and stolen relics.
