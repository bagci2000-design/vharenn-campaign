##  **Pyreborn Circle**

The Pyreborn Circle is a **fanatical sect** born from **Emberkin zealotry**, believing that only destruction can cleanse the world of its corruption. They wage war through fire—both literal and ideological—drawing the desperate, the vengeful, and those seduced by the promise of renewal through flame.

Their alignment most often falls between **Chaotic Neutral** and **Chaotic Evil**, with little patience for diplomacy or restraint. The Circle despises the **Silent Choir** and has clashed violently with the **Glacari**. Their reach extends through **guerrilla raids**, **arson campaigns**, and the targeted elimination of perceived oppressors.

Life within the Circle is dangerous: loyalty brings purpose, while dissent is punished by fire. To its members, destruction is not an end, but the soil in which they believe a purer world might grow—though few outside the Circle share this vision.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Burn offerings on volcanic altars, often accompanied by chants of renewal.
    
- Initiates prove their devotion by walking barefoot across hot coals.
    
- Export volcanic glass, obsidian weaponry, and alchemical fire.
