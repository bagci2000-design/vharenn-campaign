##  **Alabaster Concordat**

A coalition of mage cabals, arcane universities, and wandering sorcerer guilds, the Alabaster Concordat works to **regulate, preserve, and control** the use of arcane power across Vharenn. Its members range from **Neutral Good** to **Neutral Evil**, united more by necessity than moral agreement.

The Concordat **enforces magical laws**, **maintains arcane libraries**, and **dispatches envoys** to investigate disruptive or dangerous magical phenomena. They work closely with **Veylen** scholars and sometimes employ **Vyrathi** seers, but remain deeply suspicious of **Emberkin** and **Fellborn**, fearing the instability they represent.

Politics within the Concordat are layered and competitive; advancement depends on both **magical mastery** and the ability to navigate the **internal rivalries** of its many circles. Joining means stepping into a world where **knowledge is power**, **every piece of information has a price**, and power is heavily guarded.

**Adventurer Hooks:** Members tied to the Concordat may be **apprentices** sent on field missions, **enforcers** tasked with dismantling illegal magic, or **renegade mages** seeking protection.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Control the **rarest magical inks**, **enchanted parchment**, and **spell components**. Trade **knowledge** and **magical service contracts**.
    
- Major decisions are ratified through the **Rite of Ink** â€” a magical ceremony binding the written word so it cannot be altered.
