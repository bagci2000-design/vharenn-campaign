##  **Crimson Banner**

Once a warlord’s conquering host, the Crimson Banner has evolved into a **mercenary state** whose loyalty is measured only in coin and contract. Their elite companies roam [[1. Vharren World Lore/Vharenn\|Vharenn]], selling martial strength to the highest bidder while maintaining a rigid martial hierarchy.

Heritage matters little within the Banner—**discipline, skill, and results** define worth. They value outsiders like the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Bloodbound\|Bloodbound]] and [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]] engineers, but distrust the fey-blooded. While the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Remnant Thrones\|Remnant Thrones]]** see them as dangerous opportunists, others view them as a necessary counterbalance to the endless politicking of the nobility. Open hostilities exist with the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Pyreborn Circle\|Pyreborn Circle]]**, and frequent clashes occur with the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Remnant Thrones\|Remnant Thrones]].

Alignment tends toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Lawful Neutral to Chaotic Evil]]**, depending on whether a contract is bound by honour or driven purely by profit. Adventurers tied to the Banner may be **loyal soldiers**, **contract warriors**, or **former mercenaries** seeking a new cause. In service, the code is absolute: obey your orders, win your battles, and your place—and pay—are secure. Desertion is punishable by death.

Their crimson sigil serves as both a **warning** and a **promise**: they can be bought, but never swayed without payment.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Military parades double as **recruitment drives**.
    
- Blood-oath contracts are sealed with a drop of the recruit’s own blood burned in a brazier.
    
- Sell military services for **coin, food, or territory**.
    
- Trade in **captured arms** and **looted relics**.
