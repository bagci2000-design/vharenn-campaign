##  **Seasonal Courts**

The Seasonal Courts are shifting **fey alliances** that rule over parts of the **Umbralwood**, with each court embodying the temperament of its season:

- **Spring** – vibrant and unpredictable
    
- **Summer** – proud and unyielding
    
- **Autumn** – cunning and introspective
    
- **Winter** – patient and cold
    

As the year turns, power shifts between the courts, and their alignment can range from **Chaotic Good** to **Chaotic Neutral**, depending on which court holds sway.

They welcome **Veylen** and **Grimkin**, but regard most mortals as fleeting curiosities or pawns in their long games of intrigue—plots that often span decades or centuries. Rarely interested in mortal politics, they instead weave designs to shape the feywild’s influence over the material realm.

Adventurers tied to the Seasonal Courts may serve as **emissaries**, **oath-bound champions**, or **exiles** cast out for breaking fey law. To win the favour of a court is to enter a world where **words can bind like chains**, and the changing moods of an immortal ruler can alter mortal fates in an instant.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Grand festivals mark each seasonal turning point, filled with **feasts**, **riddles**, and **contests of art or song**.
- Trade feycrafted goods — dreamwine, season-shifting seeds, and glamour-infused jewellery.
