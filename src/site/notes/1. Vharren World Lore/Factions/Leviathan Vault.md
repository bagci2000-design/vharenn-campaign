##  **Leviathan Vault**

The Leviathan Vault is a **fortified oceanic stronghold** built and guarded by the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Tideforged\|Tideforged]]** and their allies. Part **archive** and part **fortress**, it houses relics and secrets from ages long past.

Its alignment tends toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Lawful Neutral]]**, with guardians bound by ancient oaths to protect what lies within. The Vault’s influence rarely reaches inland, but it maintains strong ties to **coastal city-states** and **merchant fleets**. **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Fellborn\|Fellborn]]** are treated with cautious respect, while **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Emberkin\|Emberkin]]** are often turned away at the gates.

Adventurers tied to the Vault may be tasked with **recovering stolen artefacts**, **charting dangerous sea routes**, or **acting as envoys** to the mainland. To serve the Vault is to live under constant watch, where duty is measured not only in combat but in quiet, unending vigilance against those who would plunder the ocean’s deepest secrets.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Trade agreements are sealed by exchanging **carved sea-stones**, which are then cast into the ocean to “bind” the pact in the sea’s memory.
- **Player-Facing:** Trade pearls, exotic sea-silk, deepfish oils, and rare ship designs.
