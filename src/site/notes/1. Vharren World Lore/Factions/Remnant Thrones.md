##  **Remnant Thrones**

Once rulers of the greatest empire Vharenn has ever known, the Remnant Thrones are now a **loose patchwork of quarrelling noble houses** clinging to fragments of imperial legacy. Each house claims to be the rightful heir to the long-fallen imperial crown, viewing rivals as pretenders. Their cities and fortresses are architectural marvels—**crumbling spires** and **fortified walls** that still bear the grandeur of a bygone age.

The Thrones’ society is **rigidly hierarchical**, bound by archaic codes of nobility and ceremony. Lineage is prized above all else, with bloodlines traced back to the empire’s founding heroes. While some lords strive for honourable governance, others indulge in decadence, bribery, and political intrigue. Their alignment tends toward **[[7. Campaign Mechanics/HomeBrew/Character Allignment\|Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil]]**, prioritising stability and personal power over idealism.

Despite their fragmentation, the Thrones remain a potent force. Their knights are famed for discipline, their laws for precision, and their ambitions for ruthlessness. They distrust upstarts like the **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]]** and resist fey manipulation, preferring human politics over otherworldly bargains. Many employ **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Vergir\|Vergir]]** artisans to fortify their holdings and value **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Bloodbound\|Bloodbound]]** service, while distrusting **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Veylen\|Veylen]]** and **[[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Emberkin\|Emberkin]]**.

For adventurers, ties to the Thrones might mean serving as a **knight**, **envoy**, **agent**, or **disinherited heir** seeking to reclaim a title. Within their courts, diplomacy and intrigue can be as deadly as the sword.

**Faction Economy & Influence:**

- Each noble house mints its own coins bearing dynastic sigils. These are technically interchangeable but fluctuate in value with each house’s fortunes in war or diplomacy.
    
- **Core exports**: fine steel from Dvergir-forged workshops, vellum manuscripts from cloistered scriptoria, and luxury goods looted from old imperial vaults.
    
- Grain surpluses from their breadbasket regions allow them to wield famine or feast as political leverage.
    
- Markets are lively but strictly regulated; trade charters depend on noble patronage, with tolls on every bridge and gate.
    
- Houses undercut each other’s tariffs, grant smuggling rights to mercenary companies (including the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Crimson Banner\|Crimson Banner]]), and maintain suspicion toward fey goods and Concordat alchemical imports.
    

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Seasonal tourneys combine martial combat and intricate court games.
    
- Gift-giving between houses acts as a subtle language of alliance, challenge, or insult.
