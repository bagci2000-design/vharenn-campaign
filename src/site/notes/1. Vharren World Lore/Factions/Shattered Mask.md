##  **Shattered Mask**
The Shattered Mask is a **secretive network** of infiltrators, identity brokers, and saboteurs. Predominantly composed of **Mirrorkin** and their allies, they thrive on **misinformation**, **disguise**, and **calculated disruption**.

Their alignment is typically **Chaotic Neutral**, shaped by a culture that prizes **personal reinvention** and the manipulation of perception. While they maintain a loose alliance with the **Web of the Forgotten Queen**, they operate independently, selling their services to any faction that can meet their price.

Adventurers tied to the Mask might be **former clients**, **disavowed operatives**, or **ambitious newcomers** eager to prove themselves. In the Mask’s world, **truth is malleable**, **identity is a weapon**, and loyalty is always conditional. Those who rise within the network gain access to layers of secrets capable of shifting the balance of power in Vharenn—if they can survive long enough to wield them.

**Player-Facing Notes:**

- Names are fluid; at formal gatherings, guests must wear masks and present a false name before negotiations.
- Deal in information brokering, forged identities, and counterfeited credentials.
