## **Thalyra – The Turning Seasons**

![Thalyra.png](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Thalyra.png)
**Domains:** Nature, Change, Cycles, Renewal

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Thalyra is the eternal cycle of life and death, the four faces of the year embodied in one divine being. Each season she shifts aspect: Spring the joyful youth, Summer the proud queen, Autumn the cunning sage, Winter the cold matriarch. Her temples are gardens that change with the seasons, and her followers—often druids, rangers, and farmers—look to her for guidance in planting, harvest, and renewal. Her holy symbol is a wreath of four leaves, each of a different season’s hue.
