## **Velthar – The Frozen Blade**

![Velthar.png|banne](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Velthar.png)
**Domains:** Justice, Winter, Endurance, Duty

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Velthar is the cold, clear edge of justice—impartial, unyielding, and absolute. His worship is strongest in the north, where winter’s hardships mirror his values of endurance and steadfast duty. His holy symbol is a silver sword encased in frost. His priests act as arbiters in disputes that threaten entire realms, and his paladins are known as Frostbrands—sworn to uphold oaths regardless of personal cost.
