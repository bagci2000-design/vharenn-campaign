## **Elarith – The Silent Judge**

![Elarith.png](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Elarith.png)
**Domains:** Silence, Judgment, Discipline, Truth

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Elarith is the god of stillness before the verdict, the weight of unspoken truth. His priests, called the Silent, take vows of silence, believing that words can corrupt judgment. His temples are austere halls where disputes are heard without interruption, and only the appointed voice-bearer may speak the god’s will. His symbol is a black candle on a white field, representing clarity through silence. Those who follow Elarith see speech as a tool to be used sparingly and truth as a divine burden.
