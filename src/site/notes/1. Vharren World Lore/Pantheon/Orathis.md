**Domains:** Oceans, Memory, Secrets, Depths

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Orathis is the god of the deep seas, guardian of drowned knowledge and sunken relics. Sailors offer him coins before long voyages, and scholars seek him in dreams to uncover forgotten truths. His temples are rare, often built in coastal caves where the tide washes through sanctuaries carved into the rock. His holy symbol is a nautilus shell with an eye at its centre, representing the spiralling descent into hidden truths.
