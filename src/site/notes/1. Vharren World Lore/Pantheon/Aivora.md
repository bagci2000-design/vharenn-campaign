**Domains:** Secrets, Shadows, Illusion, Intuition

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Aivora is the keeper of hidden truths and the mistress of masks. Her worship is common among spies, thieves, and illusionists, but also among scholars and mystics seeking knowledge not meant for all eyes. Depicted as a woman in a flowing hooded robe, her face obscured by moonlight, Aivora is said to guide those who walk unseen paths. Her holy symbol, a crescent moon with a single eye at its centre, represents the idea that the hidden watcher sees more clearly than the one in the open. Her temples are often disguised as other buildings—libraries, bathhouses, or theatres—serving as meeting places for those who deal in whispers and riddles.
