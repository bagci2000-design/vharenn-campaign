## **Kaelthys – The Flameborn**

![Kaelthys.png](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Kaelthys.png)
**Domains:** Fire, Destruction, Renewal, Passion

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Kaelthys is the blazing force that destroys what it sees as failures to renew, the wildfire that clears the old for the new. His followers are zealots, revolutionaries, and artisans who burn their failures to fuel future creations. Depicted as a figure crowned in flame, his holy symbol is a burning brand over a circle of ash. Worshippers see the act of burning—whether physical or symbolic—as an offering to Kaelthys, believing that nothing worth having comes without consuming what came before.
