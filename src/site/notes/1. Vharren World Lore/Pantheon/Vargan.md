## **Vargan – The Iron Tyrant**

![Vargan.png](/img/user/z.%20Assets/Vargan.png)
**Domains:** War, Strategy, Discipline, Conquest

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Vargan embodies the art of war as both destruction and order. Depicted in armour without insignia, he is revered by soldiers, mercenaries, and commanders alike. His worshippers value discipline, unity, and precision in combat above all else, believing that chaos is the enemy of victory. Temples to Vargan are more like military barracks, with training yards and war councils open to any who swear fealty. His followers believe that every battle is part of an eternal campaign, and those who die honourably in service to his cause are rewarded with a place in the Legion Eternal—a perfect, unending army in the afterlife.
