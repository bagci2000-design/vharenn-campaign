## **Tavren – The Eternal Ledger**

**Domains:** Law, Memory, Oaths, Civilization

**Player-Facing Lore:**  
Tavren is the divine scribe of Vharenn, the keeper of every oath sworn and every law etched in stone. His temples double as archives and courts, their walls lined with records of treaties, crimes, and ancestral deeds. Followers believe that to lie under Tavren’s gaze is to etch a falsehood into one’s soul, bringing shame to family and bloodline for generations. His clergy serve as judges, notaries, and historians, and his paladins—known as Oathkeepers—are tasked with enforcing contracts between kingdoms as well as between common folk. Tavren’s holy symbol is a silver quill over an open tome, representing truth and the unyielding memory of law.
