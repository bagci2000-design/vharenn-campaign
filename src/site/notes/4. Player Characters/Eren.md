⸻

Buggnight was hatched in the shadowed spindles of Silken Hollow, where the disgraced and the forgotten of the Web cling to survival. Her broodline carried the stain of failure — an old betrayal that stripped her kin of status — and that stigma has followed her like a second shadow. In every deal and every negotiation, she starts from a position of mistrust.

Rather than seek redemption in the eyes of the matriarchs, Buggnight forged her own legend. She became a bounty hunter for the Web, tracking runaway informants, debt-runners, and rivals marked for removal. She strikes from darkness with patient precision, her Ghostwise instincts allowing her to slip unseen through shadows, and her Battleborn reflexes ensuring that her first strike is often her last.

Her nickname began as an insult. The first target she ever brought back alive had mocked her “bug eyes” and the way she appeared “like the night itself, crawling closer.” She silenced him with a grin, and when the name Buggnight spread, she embraced it — better to own a name than let others wield it against you.

Her reputation is one of quiet inevitability. She can turn on the charm when needed — a single well-placed smile or whispered promise bending a conversation in her favor — but those moments are fleeting. The stigmatised weight of her lineage ensures most will never fully trust her.

Some whisper that there’s something else that drives her, a hunger she cannot name, a pull that gnaws at her when the hunt is done. Buggnight doesn’t deny it — she simply keeps moving, keeps hunting.

Because in the end, when her prey feels the silken thread tighten around them, it’s already too late.
