### Backstory
Born high among the frost-bitten peaks of a nameless mountain, Thrain Ironhold was the youngest son of a proud dvergir bloodline whose steelwork once armed kings and whose mountain keeps stood as eternal sentinels over the valleys below. His childhood was forged in the cadence of the hammer and the hiss of quenching steel, under the shadow of ancestral law and the Iron Oath — the unbreakable code that bound his house to justice, duty, and the sanctity of their word.

When the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Glacari\|Glacari]] came calling, seeking one of his bloodline for service in the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Frostbrand Tribunal\|Frostbrand Tribunal]], Thrain was chosen. Among those austere halls of ice-carved stone, he learned the art of judgment — the weighing of truth against lies, the measuring of blood debts, the cold finality of binding verdicts. As a Frostbrand, he was feared for his precision; every ruling cut as sharply as the froststeel blade he carried, and his loyalty to the code was absolute.

But where others in the Tribunal saw purity in the law, Thrain saw utility. The code was not just sacred — it was power. The word of the Tribunal could topple a chieftain without a single sword drawn. It could strip a clan of its land, its ships, its very name, all within the sanctity of “justice.” In time, that knowledge festered into something more dangerous than corruption — ambition.

When the bureaucracy of endless deliberations dulled his blood, Thrain began to drift from the Tribunal’s grip. Officially, he remains a member, bound by oaths he has never formally broken — but his absence from their courts is a quiet rebellion. He carries their authority as both shield and weapon, invoking the Frostbrand name to open doors or silence dissenters when it serves him.

His reputation reached its peak during a vicious winter campaign at sea, where he earned the name Ironhold. In a night raid aboard a frost-shrouded warship, Thrain led the boarding himself — alone breaching the enemy’s deck with druidic storms and steel, sinking the vessel and claiming its captain’s head. By dawn, the ship lay in splinters, and the spoils washed ashore crimson-stained.

Now, Thrain walks a narrow — neither oathbreaker nor loyalist. Honour, in his eyes, is not the absence of treachery — it is the art of making betrayal look like justice.
