### Backstory
Born in Fire, Bound in Ash

Long before Aegis was a name whispered on tavern lips, he was a child of empire. His bloodline, though thought extinguished, descended from one of the founding houses of the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Remnant Thrones\|Remnant Thrones]] — a line bound not to wealth or intrigue, but to guardianship. His house bore the duty of shielding the empire’s borders, its sigil a black shield on silver.

When the God-Wars tore the world asunder, his people stood firm. Aegis himself — then a warrior, proud and mortal — fell at the walls of his keep, impaled upon a hundred blades while defending his kin. Yet death did not claim him. Like others caught in the divine cataclysm, he rose again from the ash — one of the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Ashenborn\|Ashenborn]], his flesh refusing the grave, his heart smoldering with grief. He bore witness as his house was razed, his name struck from the chronicles, his throne dissolved into dust.

For centuries, Aegis wandered the wastelands, a husk of rage and sorrow. He abandoned nobility, his once-gleaming armor rusting to ruin, carrying only the shield that would not break — the same shield that had once protected his family crest.

A Forgotten Legacy

The world changed. Kingdoms rose and fell, yet whispers endured: a shield of ash, a warrior unbroken, an heir who would not die. The nobles of the fractured [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Remnant Thrones\|Remnant Thrones]] dismissed it as peasant superstition — yet some houses feared the truth, and quietly erased any mention of his line.

Aegis himself believed he was nothing but a cursed wanderer, until three events began to reshape his fate:
	•	In a ruined crypt, he uncovered a shattered crown, still bearing his family sigil.
	•	An ancient [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Glacari\|Glacari]] seer spoke of him by name, declaring: “The Heir walks still, but his throne is yet unclaimed.”
	•	Rival Remnant lords, hearing rumors of his survival, sent assassins — proof enough that some still see him as a threat to their claim.

These revelations rekindled the ember in his chest. He was no longer content to simply wander. If the Thrones had forgotten his line, he would remind them. If they had scattered his kin, he would gather them. From ash, a kingdom would rise again.

⸻

Present Path

Now, Aegis moves through the world as a barbarian, his fury drawn from centuries of loss but tempered by a strange, enduring honor. He seeks strength not only for himself, but for the day when he must carve his claim into history once more. Every ally is a potential banner-bearer for the future; every battle is training for the war to come.

He does not yet call himself king. But those who meet his gaze see more than a wandering warrior — they see a throne waiting to be set upon unbroken shoulders.
