📜 Backstory: The Weaponmaster and the Spark

Born into the modest but respected House Aetherwulf, Alistair grew up surrounded by the hum of gears, the scent of enchanted metal, and the disciplined philosophies of arcane engineering. His family had long served the [[1. Vharren World Lore/Factions/Alabaster Concordat\|Alabaster Concordat]] as arcane craftsmen, specializing in the fusion of magic and machine.

At the age of twelve, Alistair was apprenticed to Master Kelen Vrysmar, a pioneering artificer who believed that true mastery of magic-tech required not only intellect and precision, but also adaptability and discipline. Under Vrysmar, Alistair learned a wide range of crafting disciplines—metalwork, enchanting, alchemical synthesis, and advanced glyphwork—paired with rigorous arcane theory.

However, Vrysmar’s teachings didn’t stop at the workshop bench. He insisted that his apprentice also train in weapons particularly the; scimitar, hand axe, light crossbow, revolver and close-quarters combat, believing that an artificer who could wield his own creations in battle was far more effective than one who stood behind them. Alistair trained daily with Concordat enforcer-instructors, honing his reflexes and learning to read combat rhythms as easily as magical ones.

⚙ From Apprentice to Enforcer

When Master Vrysmar perished during a leyline containment mission, Alistair was devastated—but not derailed. With his master’s teachings etched into his mind and tools crafted by his own hands, Alistair joined the Circle of Arcane Compliance as a field Enforcer.

There, he took on missions across Vharenn—hunting rogue mages, investigating arcane disruptions, and recovering lost or illegal magical devices. His combination of magical knowledge, technical skill, and close-combat capability set him apart. Whether it was disarming a soulbound construct or dueling a spellblade rogue in tight corridors, Alistair handled it with calculated precision.

As he continues to refine his craft, Alistair now stands at a crossroads—considering the path of the Battlesmith, to build a combat companion and specialize in magical warfare, or the Armorer, turning his own body into a living weapon.

🐺 The Legacy of Aetherwulf

The name Aetherwulf carries more than noble weight—it whispers of a long-buried myth: a primal wolf spirit once bound to a member of the house, tied to a failed Concordat experiment in sentient aether-forged guardians. Alistair believes the spirit may be awakening again… and that it stirs within him.

Sometimes, during moments of intense focus or danger, his constructs growl faintly. His spells hum like a hunting call. And always, behind it all, is the sense of being watched by something old and powerful.

🛠 Possible Subclass Evolution

Battlesmith: Alistair builds a semi-sentient construct companion—perhaps a wolf-like aether mech named Fen. Combines melee combat and magical strikes.

Armorer: Alistair forges a custom suit of magical armor, channeling power through integrated arcane cores—possibly inspired by the wolf spirit’s resilience and agility.
