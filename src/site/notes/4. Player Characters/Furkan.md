### Backstory
When I was a boy my small village town was raided by [[1. Vharren World Lore/Races/Fellborn\|Fellborn]] my parents murdered left me an orphan to the state I passed around from place to place my quick wit and charisma led me to stay alive this ended up with me being adopted by the Blackwater crime family they sensed a use for my talents I soon began running their illegal pet trade anything from werewolves to wyverns were for sale after years of operating outside the law the kingdoms enforcers closed in around us not being of blood to the family I was pinned as an escape goat I barely escaped with my life before stowing away on a ship headed for Vharenn posing as a travelling bard that would sing for any open ears with coin to toss my way.
