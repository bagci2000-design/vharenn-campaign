## **Vharenn Survival & Combat Cheat Sheet**

### **1. Hunger & Exhaustion**

- **Hunger Penalties** accumulate if a character goes without food:
    
- **Hunger/Exhaustion** begins to accumulate at **1 level per day for below Mild activity** and at **2 levels per day for above Mild activity**

| Level | Penalty                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Disadvantage on **ability checks**                                                                                               |
| **2** | Speed halved                                                                                                                     |
| **3** | Disadvantage on **attack rolls & saving throws** + minor HP loss per hour (1–2 HP)                                               |
| **4** | Max HP halved & disadvantage on all checks                                                                                       |
| **5** | Speed = 0, cannot take standard actions + must succeed on **death save at start of turn** or fall unconscious and + 1 Exhaustion |
| **6** | Death / permanent incapacitation                                                                                                 |

- **Mitigation:** Eating **reduces Hunger by 1–2 levels**, depending on quality & quantity.

### **2. Combat Exhaustion (Grievous Injuries)**

- **Each time a character hits 0 HP** → gain **1 level of Combat Exhaustion** (stacking with any existing Exhaustion).
    
- Represents **lasting injury from mortal wounds**.
    

| Level | Combat Penalty                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Disadvantage on **ability checks** + **Max HP -5%**                                                                                     |
| **2** | Speed halved + **Max HP -10%**                                                                                                          |
| **3** | Disadvantage on **attack rolls & saving throws** + minor HP loss per hour (1–2 HP)                                                      |
| **4** | Max HP halved + prone at start of combat & disadvantage on all checks                                                                   |
| **5** | Speed = 0, cannot take standard actions + must succeed on **death save at start of combat turn** or fall unconscious and + 1 Exhaustion |
| **6** | Death / permanent incapacitation                                                                                                        |

- **Recovery:** Combat Exhaustion can only be reduced by:
    
    - Safe long-term rest with medical treatment
        
    - Magical healing or divine intervention

### **3. Total Exhaustion Effects**

- When **General** + **Combat** exhaustion combine:
    
    - Effects **stack**, but overlapping penalties **do not multiply** (e.g., Speed halved remains halved).
        
    - Makes the **party weaker over repeated fights or extended survival situations**.

### **4. Safe Rest Bonuses**

|Environment|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Tavern / Inn**|+1 Recovery per night; temporary advantage on **ability checks** next day|
|**Camp (secure)**|Rest restores some HP; reduces 1 Hunger level; +1 Recovery for next skill check|
|**Rough Shelter / Wilderness**|Half recovery; +1 Hunger if sleeping poorly|
|**Unsafe / Hostile Environment**|No recovery; +1 Hunger or temporary exhaustion if forced to rest|

> **Tip:** Players encouraged to **seek safe rest**—resting in a tavern or friendly stronghold can significantly reduce risk of long-term exhaustion.

### **5. Health, Damage & Death**

- **Hitting 0 HP = serious injury**, not just “downed” state
    
- Players **do not automatically regain full HP** after combat
    
- Each 0 HP event adds **+1 Combat Exhaustion**
    
- HP recovery requires:
    
    - Short-term: magical healing, bandaging, or moderate rest
        
    - Long-term: safe rest + treatment
        
- **Permanent injury narrative:** High Combat Exhaustion levels reflect limping, bruises, or lasting trauma
