## **Vharenn Survival & Combat Cheat Sheet**

### **1. Hunger & General Exhaustion**

- **Hunger Penalties** accumulate if a character goes without food:
    

|Hunger Level|Effect|
|---|---|
|**1 (Peckish)**|Minor fatigue; disadvantage on **ability checks**|
|**2 (Hungry)**|Speed **halved**; disadvantage on **skill checks**|
|**3 (Famished)**|Disadvantage on **attack rolls & saving throws**|
|**4 (Starving)**|Max HP **halved**; disadvantage on **all checks**|
|**5 (Near Death)**|Speed = 0; unable to take standard actions|
|**6 (Dead)**|Death|

- **Mitigation:** Eating rations, hunting, or purchasing meals **reduces Hunger by 1–2 levels**, depending on quality & quantity.

### **2. Combat Exhaustion (Grievous Injuries)**

- **Each time a character hits 0 HP** → gain **1 level of Combat Exhaustion** (stacking with any existing General Exhaustion).
    
- Represents **lasting injury from mortal wounds**.
    

|Level|Combat Penalty|
|---|---|
|**1**|Disadvantage on **ability checks** + **Max HP -5%**|
|**2**|Speed halved + **Max HP -10%**|
|**3**|Disadvantage on **attack rolls & saving throws** + minor HP loss per hour (1–2 HP)|
|**4**|Max HP halved + prone at start of combat & disadvantage on all checks|
|**5**|Speed = 0, cannot take standard actions + must succeed on **death save at start of combat** or fall unconscious|
|**6**|Death / permanent incapacitation|

- **Recovery:** Combat Exhaustion can only be reduced by:
    
    - Safe long-term rest with medical treatment
        
    - Magical healing or divine intervention

### **3. Total Exhaustion Effects**

- When **General** + **Combat** exhaustion combine:
    
    - Effects **stack**, but overlapping penalties **do not multiply** (e.g., Speed halved remains halved).
        
    - Makes the **party weaker over repeated fights or extended survival situations**.

### **4. Safe Rest Bonuses**

|Environment|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Tavern / Inn**|+1 Recovery per night; temporary advantage on **ability checks** next day|
|**Camp (secure)**|Rest restores some HP; reduces 1 Hunger level; +1 Recovery for next skill check|
|**Rough Shelter / Wilderness**|Half recovery; +1 Hunger if sleeping poorly|
|**Unsafe / Hostile Environment**|No recovery; +1 Hunger or temporary exhaustion if forced to rest|

> **Tip:** Players encouraged to **seek safe rest**—resting in a tavern or friendly stronghold can significantly reduce risk of long-term exhaustion.

### **5. Health, Damage & Death**

- **Hitting 0 HP = serious injury**, not just “downed” state
    
- Players **do not automatically regain full HP** after combat
    
- Each 0 HP event adds **+1 Combat Exhaustion**
    
- HP recovery requires:
    
    - Short-term: magical healing, bandaging, or moderate rest
        
    - Long-term: safe rest + treatment
        
- **Permanent injury narrative:** High Combat Exhaustion levels reflect limping, bruises, or lasting trauma
