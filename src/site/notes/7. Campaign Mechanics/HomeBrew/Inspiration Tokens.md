### **1. What Is an Inspiration Token?**

An **Inspiration Token** is a tangible mark of exceptional roleplay, creative problem-solving, or meaningful contribution to the story.  
It allows a player character (PC) to declare an **automatic success** on one action — within reason and narrative possibility.

---

### **2. Earning Inspiration Tokens**

Players can earn a token by:

- **Playing in character** authentically and engagingly.
    
- **Using creative or clever thinking** to solve complex challenges.
    
- **Contributing to the story** or group success in an impactful way.
    
- **Demonstrating teamwork or selflessness** that enhances the table’s enjoyment.
    

> 🎲 _Tokens are awarded at the DM’s discretion immediately after the qualifying moment._

---

### **3. Token Limits**

- Each player may **hold a maximum of one** Inspiration Token at any time.
    
- A total of **ten (10) Inspiration Tokens** may exist in circulation across the entire party at once.
    
    - If the cap is reached, no new tokens can be awarded until one is spent or removed.
        
- Tokens **do carry over between sessions** unless the DM explicitly states otherwise.

### **4. Using an Inspiration Token**

A player must declare the use of an Inspiration Token **before the/any outcome is revealed** via any party member or the DM.  
When used, the token grants an **automatic success** on the declared action.

#### **Examples of Valid Uses**

- **Attack rolls:** Guaranteed hit.
    
- **Skill checks:** Automatic success, within reason.
    
- **Saving throws:** Automatic pass.
    
- **Death saving throws:** Automatic success.
    
- **Critical moments:** Persuading NPCs, performing cinematic stunts, or saving an ally.
    

---

### **5. “Within Reason” Clause**

The automatic success must remain **plausible** within the setting, character ability, and narrative.

**Guidelines:**

- Allowed: Achievable but difficult feats (e.g. catching a falling ally, disarming a trap mid-battle).
    
- Not allowed: Impossible or physics-breaking acts (e.g. flying without means, ignoring lethal magic).
    
- If borderline, the DM will make a judgement call and may allow a **partial success** consistent with intent.
    

> ✅ If it could _conceivably_ succeed through luck, timing, or extraordinary effort — it’s valid.  
> ❌ If it _rewrites reality_ — it’s not.

---

### **6. Using Tokens on Others**

- A player may **use their Inspiration Token to benefit another PC**, granting that ally the automatic success instead.
    
- However, **only the token holder** may decide **when** and **how** it is used — never the recipient.
    
- This decision must be declared **before the DM reveals any roll outcome**.
