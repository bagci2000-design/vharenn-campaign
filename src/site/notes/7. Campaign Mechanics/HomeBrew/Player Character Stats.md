## Vharenn's Homebrew Rules

Your character’s **ability scores** define their strength, skill, resilience, and presence in Vharenn. Follow these instructions to create, advance, and use your stats.

---

### **Core Stat Allocation**

- You have **6 ability scores**: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA).
    
- Distribute **60 points** among your stats.
    
- Each stat must be **between 6 and 16** at character creation (Level 1).
    
- No two stats may differ by more than **5 points**.
    
- Example: If STR is 16, your next lowest stat must be **at least 11**.
    
- Assign your stats manually to reflect your character’s concept and role.

### **2. Scaling Modifier Table**

Use the following table to determine modifiers for checks, attacks, and saving throws:

|Stat|Modifier|
|---|---|
|6–7|-2|
|8–9|-1|
|10–11|+0|
|12–13|+1|
|14–15|+2|
|16–17|+3|
|18–19|+4|
|20|+5|

- Modifiers are applied **only when relevant** (e.g., Saves, DEX for stealth, WIS for perception, etc.).

### **3. Level-Up & Ability Score Improvements (ASI)**

- You gain **Ability Score Improvements (ASIs)** at levels **4, 8, 12, 16, and 19**.
    
- When you take an ASI, choose one:
    
    1. Increase **one ability score by 2**
    **OR**
    2. Increase **two ability scores by 1 each**
    
- No ability score may **exceed 20 via ASI's** .
    

**Level-by-Level Maximum Ability Score Caps**

| Level | Max Ability Score |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1     | 16                |
| 2     | 16                |
| 3     | 16                |
| 4     | 17                |

| 18    | 20                |
| 19    | 20                |

### **4. Training System**

- Training increases stats **outside of ASIs**, but costs **time, money, and effort**.
    
- Each training attempt requires **a period of downtime**.
    
- Paying **"X" gp**, depending on difficulty and mentor rarity.
    
- Roll a **skill check** to see if training succeeds, For example:
    

| Stat | Training Check                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| STR  | Athletics                              |
| DEX  | Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand          |
| CON  | Constitution saving throw or Endurance |
| INT  | Arcana, History, or Investigation      |
| WIS  | Insight or Perception                  |
| CHA  | Persuasion or Deception                |

- **Success:** +1 to the chosen stat.
    
- **Failure:** No improvement, resources spent.
    
- **Rare Training:** Exceptional mentors or challenges may allow +2 gains, higher DCs, and/or permanent modifier bonuses.
    

> Training is optional but necessary if you want to improve stats outside ASI levels or for stats to exceed 20 when level requirement is met.

### **5. Item Requirements & Scaling**

- Weapons, armour, and gear may have **minimum stat requirements**.
    
- Using an item below its requirement reduces effectiveness:
    
    - **Example: Greatsword requires STR 14 → if STR 12, attack rolls take -1 per 2 points below 14.
        
    - **Example: Longbow requires DEX 12 → if DEX 10, damage rolls take -1d4.
        
- Some items provide **stat bonuses**:
    
    - Certain gear grants **+1 to +3** modifier to relevant stat.
        
    - Bonuses **can not stack above +3** for balance.
        
- **Scaling Items:** Effectiveness may increase further if your stats exceed minimum requirements. 
    - **Example: STR 16 Greatsword → if STR 18 +3 damage bonus from strength.
    
    - **Example: DEX 14 Bow → +2 accuracy bonus.
